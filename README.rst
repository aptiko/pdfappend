===================================================================
Simple CLI utility to append one or more PDFs at the end of another
===================================================================

This is a thin wrapper around pypdf2.

::

    pdfappend base_document.pdf [document_to_append.pdf ...]

If no document to append is specified, ``tmp.pdf`` is assumed.  The base
document is replaced in place and ``tmp.pdf`` (or the specified
documents to append) are deleted.
